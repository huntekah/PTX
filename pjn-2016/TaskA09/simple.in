A battalion chief who had been considered a rising star in the New York Fire Department was killed Tuesday, Sept. 27, when a row house exploded as he was supervising an evacuation following the report of a gas leak. Authorities are looking into whether the building was used to grow marijuana.

Later Tuesday, investigators said they were questioning a person of interest but provided no details.

The two-story house and adjoining homes in the Bronx had already been emptied of occupants and fire personnel had been on the scene for an hour when the 7:30 a.m. blast jolted neighbors awake, tore off the building's roof, and hurled pieces of wood and brick into the street.

Michael Fahy, a 17-year fire department veteran and father of three, was directing operations from the street when he was hit by falling debris, authorities said. (AP)
